## Performance

| | **Asus ExpertBook Ultra** | ~~**Dell XPS 14**~~ | **HP OmniBook Ultra 14** | **Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 14** | **Lenovo X9 15p** | **Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Ultra** | **Samsung Galaxy Book6 Pro 14** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Sustained TDP** | 41W PL1 | 28W base | Not specified | 30W | 45W | Not specified | Not specified |
| **Boost TDP** | 63W PL2 | Up to 45W | Not specified | Not specified | Not specified | Not specified | Not specified |

All seven laptops share Intel's Arc B390 integrated GPU, delivering near-RTX 4050-level graphics performance — a generational leap over Lunar Lake and Arrow Lake. Note: the Yoga Slim 7i Ultra's base config (Core Ultra 7 355) has only 4 Xe3 GPU cores vs 12 on the X-series chips, significantly reducing graphics performance. Performance drops significantly on battery across all models; AC power is required for full GPU throughput.

### Sustained Performance Ranking

| Scenario | Ranking |
|---|---|
| **Sustained workloads** | X9 15p (45W) > Asus (41W) > Lenovo X1 (30W) > Dell (28W) |
| **Short burst performance** | Asus (63W) > Dell (45W) > X9 15p / X1 Carbon (TBD) |
| **Performance per kg** | Asus (37W/kg) > X9 15p (32W/kg) > X1 Carbon (30W/kg) > Dell (19.4W/kg) |

### Battery Life (Tested)

| | **Battery** | **Tested Life** | **Test Details** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dell XPS 14** | 70Wh | ~16h 45m | WLAN browsing, 150 nits (NotebookCheck) |
| **Samsung Galaxy Book6 Pro 14** | 67Wh | ~18h 30m | SDR video, 170 nits (Expert Reviews) |
| **Asus ExpertBook Ultra** | 70Wh | ~15h (video) / ~12h (real-world) | Video loop 200 nits (PCWorld) / mixed dev use |
| **Lenovo X1 Carbon Gen 14** | 58Wh | Not yet tested | Expected ~12–14h based on prior gens |
| **Lenovo X9 15p** | 88Wh | Not yet tested | Largest battery but highest TDP (45W) |
| **HP OmniBook Ultra 14** | 70Wh | Not yet tested | — |
| **Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Ultra** | 75Wh | Not yet tested | — |

The Dell XPS 14's low 28W base TDP gives it the best efficiency ratio — Tom's Guide called it "the longest-lasting laptop we've ever tested." The X9 15p has the biggest battery (88Wh) but its 45W sustained TDP will consume it faster under load.

## Verdict

- **Asus ExpertBook Ultra** — Best all-around 14" performer. Highest review score, strongest sustained power in its size class, most storage. The business power user's pick.
- **Dell XPS 14** — Available now and most affordable. Best multimedia experience with superior speakers (among 14" models), touchscreen, and 4K webcam. The most refined consumer-facing design.
- **Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 14** — The sub-1 kg ultraportable champion with class-leading repairability and the best webcam. Trade-off is the smallest battery (58Wh) and lowest sustained TDP (30W).
- **Lenovo ThinkPad X9 15p** — The power and productivity pick. Biggest battery, best CPU, best ports, best speakers. A true MacBook Pro alternative that matches the Dell on weight (1.4 kg) despite the larger 15.3" screen and 88Wh battery.
- **Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Ultra** — The lightest and most affordable at 975g and $1,499.99. Brightest display (1,100 nits) with 100% AdobeRGB. Trade-offs are minimal ports (3x TB4 only), max 32GB RAM, and base config (Core Ultra 7 355) has significantly fewer GPU/CPU cores than the X-series chips.
- **HP OmniBook Ultra 14** — The durable pick. MIL-STD-810 rated with vapor chamber cooling, X9 388H chip, and up to 64GB RAM at 1.27 kg. Competitive pricing at $1,549.99. Ports limited to 3x TB4 only.
- **Samsung Galaxy Book6 Pro 14** — The thinnest at 11.6mm, lightest X7 358H laptop at 1.24 kg. Anti-reflective AMOLED touchscreen with Dolby Atmos. Trade-offs are only 2x TB4, weakest webcam (2MP), and smallest battery among 14" models (67Wh).

| **Ports** | 3x TB5, HDMI, SD card, MagSafe | Varies by model |
| **Display** | 14.2" Liquid Retina XDR, 120Hz | 14–15.3" OLED/AMOLED, 120Hz |

### Benchmarks

| Benchmark | M5 | Panther Lake X9 388H | Winner |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Single-core CPU** | Significantly ahead | Behind (even M3 beats 388H) | **M5** |
| **Multi-core CPU** | Slightly ahead | Close behind | **M5** (narrowly) |
| **Cinebench 24 multi** | 922 | 1,285 | **Panther Lake** |
| **GPU (OpenCL)** | Behind | Ahead | **Panther Lake** |
| **GPU (Metal/native)** | Optimized for macOS | N/A | **M5** (on macOS) |
| **Video transcode** | Faster | Slower | **M5** |

### Key Differences

- **Efficiency**: M5 runs at 15W vs 25W — better battery life per watt. MacBook gets ~18h+ on 72.4Wh; most Panther Lake 14" laptops with 70Wh get 12–17h.
- **Battery on/off behaviour**: Panther Lake loses ~20% performance on battery. M5 maintains near-full performance unplugged.
- **GPU/gaming**: Arc B390 beats M5 in gaming benchmarks — near-RTX 4050 level.
- **Single-core**: M5 remains the fastest single-threaded laptop chip.
- **Multi-core**: Panther Lake closes the gap with 16 cores vs 10 and wins Cinebench multi-core.
- **RAM**: Panther Lake offers up to 64GB vs 32GB max on base M5.
- **Weight**: 5 of the 7 Panther Lake laptops here weigh less than the MacBook Pro's 1.55 kg.
- **Ports**: MacBook Pro has TB5, SD card, and MagSafe. Most Panther Lake laptops have TB4; only the X9 15p has an SD card slot.
- **For dev work**: M5 MacBook Pro is the safer pick for efficiency and battery consistency. Panther Lake is competitive if you need 64GB RAM, prefer Windows/Linux, or want better gaming.

## Software Development Notes

For dev workloads (IDEs, Docker, browsers, terminals, video calls), key factors are sustained CPU performance, RAM ceiling, keyboard quality, ports for external monitors, and battery life.

### Best for Software Development

| Priority | Recommended |
|---|---|
| **Best overall dev laptop** | ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 14 — up to 64GB RAM, best keyboard (ThinkPad, modular), best repairability, best ports for monitors (3x TB4 + HDMI), ~1.0 kg, best webcam for calls |
| **Best for heavy builds/compiles** | ThinkPad X9 15p — highest sustained TDP (45W), up to 64GB RAM, 88Wh battery, 15.3" screen shows more code |
| **Best battery life for dev** | Dell XPS 14 — ~16h 45m tested, 28W base TDP is most efficient. Trade-off: weakest sustained performance when plugged in |
| **Best value with X9 chip** | HP OmniBook Ultra 14 — X9 388H + 64GB RAM at $1,549.99, vapor chamber cooling. Trade-off: only 3x TB4 (need a dock for HDMI/USB-A) |

### Avoid for Dev Work

- **Yoga Slim 7i Ultra** and **Samsung Galaxy Book6 Pro 14** — capped at 32GB RAM, limiting for Docker, VMs, and heavy multitasking
- **Dell XPS 14** (for performance) — lowest sustained TDP (28W) means slower compiles when plugged in, and only 3x TB4 ports (no USB-A/HDMI without a dock)
